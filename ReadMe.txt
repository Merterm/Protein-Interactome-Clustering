******* What You Will Need ********

You need python3 installed with
scipy
numpy
networkx
math
sklearn
modules …
to run all the codes without any problems.

******* To Run The Code(s) ********
Go into the directory where the files are

	$ —> python3 ensemble.py

This command will run the ensemble code that makes use of both MCL and k-clique algorithms. It uses Worm Interactome dataset of 2007 from Harvard as default. To run them individually;

	$ —> python3 k_clique_networkX.py ‘wi.txt’ 

Instead of ‘wi.txt’ you can write your data file’s name.

To run Louvain algorithm;

	$ —> python3 test.py

Unfortunately cast.py does not work accurately!
